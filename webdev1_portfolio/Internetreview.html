    <title>My Review of the Internet</title>
   <h1> The Internet: </h1>
</head>

    <p>
        To be honest, I am not really sure how I am supposed to feel about it, mostly because I don't know too much about it. It was created in 1983 I believe. From then, the Internet has been the foundation to so many new things. The biggest probably being the World Wide Web, in which one search seems like it could have infinite results. I just wonder how that it is even possible? and what even is the quality of the very last site on the very last page like? Probably not great and yet it still exists.

        Does anyone really know the extent of the Internet's capabilities? Will we always have enough networks and connectivity available somewhere for it to exist? Maybe those are dumb questions to ask, but I just don't understand it.

        There is so so so so much I do not know about the internet. However, the one thing I do know is that I would be so lost without it.
        For that reason, I will rate it on two scales:
        <p>
            <b>Ability to confuse me: 10/10   Usefulness: 11/10
         </b>
    <p>Despite how much it confuses me, I appreciate it much more.</p>
